Welcome to <b>Book Uploader Bot (BUB)</b> Project. This file demonstrates the contributing guidelines that every developer/mentor has to adhere for GirlScript Summer of Code'20. This is required in order to create a unified development environment. Let's start.

## The Git Workflow
The workflow that we'll be using is <b> Dev - Staging - Production</b>. All the Pull Request (PR's) will be made to <b>develop</b> branch.
The mentors shall review the PR. If any change is required in the PR, the mentors shall comment on the PR itself else if
everything is good, the mentors will merge the PR to the develop branch.<br />
To read more about this workflow, you can visit [this link](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/deployments/best-practices.html).

## Fork
<b>It is strictly for the participants. Please read it carefully.</b><br />
Every participant(s) is required to fork this repository and make changes on the forked repository and after making all the changes, make a Pull Request to <b>devlop branch</b>.

## Issue creation
<b>It is strictly for the admin and mentors. Please read it carefully. </b><br />
Mentors and admin are requested to make issues and mark them with GSSoC20 label. Add separate labels like beginner, easy, medium, hard and taken. If a particular issue is assigned to someone mark it as taken. If that person does not respond or show any progress within 2-3 days remove the taken tag.

Please reach out to any of the below mentors for any help. Happy Contributing!
