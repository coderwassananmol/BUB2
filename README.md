A book uploader bot that transfers documents from public libraries such as Google Books, and Punjab Digital Library etc to Internet Archive. Built for Wikimedia Tool Labs. Check out [BUB2 on Toolforge](https://bub2.toolforge.org)!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ( check for installation with `npm -v` and `node -v` on terminal )
- [Docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) ( Optional )
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### Local setup

#### Clone the repo

- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/coderwassananmol/BUB2`
- Navigate to the project directory on the terminal: `cd BUB2`.
- For developers, checkout to develop branch: `git checkout develop`
- Run `npm install`

#### Set environment variables

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Then, to fill the credentials,

- Make an account on [archive.org](https://archive.org) and note down the sign-in credentials. Using these details, fill 'email' and 'password' fields in the `.env` file.
- Go to https://archive.org/account/s3.php . Generate the **access** and **secret** keys and fill
  them in the `.env` file in the corresponding fields.
- Go to [Google Developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/getting-started). Make a new project to run the app. In that Google Developers project, search for 'Books API' in the Google API console, then **enable** the API for the project, then generate the **API keys**, and then copy and paste the API key in the `GB_Key` field.
- Fill the `redishost` field with **docker** if you are using docker, otherwise **127.0.0.1**
- Fill the `redisport` field with **6379**, which is the default port number for redis.
- Fill `service` field with your mail service provider (Ex. gmail, outlook)
  Note: In order to send email through gmail, you may need to allow less secure app access. To turn it on, go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1

### Run Redis server

- Refer to [Redis](https://redis.io/download) for download and setup documentation ,or

#### Running Redis using Docker

```
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
docker start redis
```

#### Running Redis using Docker Compose

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose start
```

#### Start the server

- Run `npm run dev` for development and `npm run start` for production.
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

## Keep Supporting

There was no Node.js wrapper available for Internet Archive, so I decided to write the Node implementation to upload books to Internet Archive. If you like this repository, show your support by starring the project. Cheers!
