# Book Uploader Bot Code of Conduct
In order to promote an open and welcoming atmosphere, we as contributors and maintainers commit ourselves to make involvement in our project and in our group a harassment-free experience for all irrespective of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviour which contributes to the development of a positive environment include:
* There should be clear communication.
* Listen to everyone's ideas.
* Learn all the aspects before coming to conclusion.
* Using inoffensive language
* Attaining positive work environment should be one of everybody's goals

Examples of unacceptable participant actions include:
* Use of unethical means to attain an end.
* Putting self interest above group interest.
* Disrespecting an individual on the basis of gender, religion or culture.
* Publishing private details of people, such as physical or email addresses, without their prior consent
* Undertaking the action of insider trading

## Our Responsibilities
Authorities are responsible for creating an environment where everyone is treated equally and strict actions should be taken in case of unacceptable behaviour.
Authorities have the duty and responsibility to delete, modify, or reject comments, code, wiki updates, problems and other contributions that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct, or temporarily or permanently ban any user for other actions that they find unacceptable, disruptive, offensive or harmful.

## Scope
This code of conduct is applicable to all the content on Book Uploader website and all other websites which are linked to it whether offline or online.
The code of conduct is also linked within project spaces and in public spaces where an individual is representing Book Uploader or its community.

## Conflict Resolution
Conflict in most cases arises when there is a difference of opinion and people involved are not in a state to listen/understand the point of view of the other person. The severity of conflicts could vary from a mere disagreement to disrespectful exchange of words to more intense situations like physical violence. If you are experiencing any issue, we encourage you to use following strategies:
* Fix the alleged dispute directly with the parties concerned, preferably in a real-time medium.
* If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intervene.
* If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.


## Reporting Violations
Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to Book Uploader's concerned team. Then the team will investigate whether the Code of Conduct was violated and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces or project forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.
